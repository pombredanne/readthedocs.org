Tickets
-------

If you are just getting started with the project,
we have tickets labeled `Good First Bug`_.
This is a great way to get started.

If you want to help with a bigger feature,
there are a set of tickets with a `Feature Overview`_ tag.
These tickets have a general overview and description of the work required to finish.
If you want to start somewhere,
this would be a good place to start.
That said,
these aren't necessarily the easiest tickets.
They are simply things that are explained.
