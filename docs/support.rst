Getting Help
=============

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the ``#readthedocs``
channel on Freenode_. We hang out there and you can get real-time help with
your projects.  The other good way is to open an issue on Github_.

The mailing list at `readthedocs@librelist.org`_ is also available for support.

Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

Backwards Incompatible Changes will be emailed to the mailing list,
`readthedocs@librelist.org`_. They will be prefixed with "Backwards
Incompatible Changes". We are thinking about having some kind of Backwards
Incompatible Changes policy, much like the 1.0 of a code base, once we define
the redirects and interfaces that we wish to expose permanently.
