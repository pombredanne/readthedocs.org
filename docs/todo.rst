Todo
====

Easy
----
* Internationalization (i18n)
* Screencast of "Hosting your docs in 1 minute"
* Write better API docs at http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html (https://github.com/deceze/Sphinx-HTTP-domain)

Sprintable
----------
* Fast frontend for filtering docs as you type (api-driven)
* Inline commenting ala Django Book (http://ucomment.org/contents/)
* Add a widget for RTD like travis-ci
* Add a way to track pageviews internal to RTD.
    - Have a slug 
    - Use the API to track this.
    - Count Pageviews, which domain/CNAME it was served on, version, etc.

Design
------
* Have a way to hide the bottom right widget (slides away)
* Make a richer experience with the widget (eg. PDF downloads)

Hard/Refactors
--------------
* Internationalization (i18n)
* Make hosting RTD internally more supported/easier
* Make the readthedocs.org front-end i18n
